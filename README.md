<p>How far you live from work, school and other places you frequent can cost 
you time, money and health. The U.S. Census says that the average commute 
takes Americans 27.6 minutes each way. That’s more than 240 hours 
annually, if you commute twice every workday in 2021. And now that many 
people have cut back their commutes by working from home during the COVID-
19 pandemic, you might be thinking about how to save money by carpooling 
or biking, or you might consider moving to shorten the commuter distance. 
In either case, SmartAsset examined the largest cities in America to 
uncover the worst commutes in 2021. Find out how your commute measures up 
against them.</p>

<H3> Overview </H3>

<p>We compared data from the 100 largest U.S. cities and ranked the worst 
commutes by six key metrics: commuters as a percentage of workers, average 
travel time to work, five-year change in average travel time, percentage 
of workers with a commute of more than 60 minutes, five-year change in 
percentage of workers with a commute of over 60 minutes, and 
transportation as a percentage of income. For details on our data sources 
and how we put all the information together to create our final rankings, 
check out the Data and Methodology below.</p>

<h3>Key Findings</h3>

<img src="https://rdcnewscdn.realtor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/worst-commutes-map.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="300" height="185">



  <ul>
  <li>California leads the country as the state with the worst commutes. Eight 
      out of the 11 cities on this list are located in the Golden State, 
      averaging 33.6 minutes in travel time to work. Commuters in those cities 
      need twice as long as those with the shortest commute – in Lubbock, Texas, 
      which averages a little more than 16 minutes on a trip to work.</li>
  <li>The overwhelming majority of workers in America are commuters. On average, 
      94.3% of workers in the 100 largest U.S. cities are commuters, based on 
      the most recently available Census data from 2019. Scottsdale, Arizona has 
      the smallest percentage of commuters, but it still has 82.1% of its 
      workers traveling to their jobs. Newark, New Jersey has the highest 
      percentage, with 98% of workers averaging almost 35 minutes commuting.</li>
  <li>The Midwest still offers better commutes. Cities in Northeastern, Southern 
      and Western states tend to rank in the worst third of the study for their 
      less-than-ideal commutes. While Chicago, Illinois and Cincinnati, Ohio 
      crack the top 35 cities with the worst commutes, all other Midwestern 
      cities rank in the bottom half of the list for their relatively short 
      commutes.</li>
</ul>
